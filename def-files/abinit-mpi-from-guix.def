%help
    This container embedds Abinit (version 9.10.1) with OpenMPI support.
    For more information about this image, please run "apptainer inspect <this-image>"

    If you use "apptainer run <this-image>", the main executable "abinit" will be called.
    For more information about it, please use "apptainer run <this-image> -h"
    or "apptainer exec <this-image> abinit -h".

    If you want to run another executable from the Abinit suite, you can use
    "apptainer exec <this-image> <executable-name>".

    If you want to specify MPI number of processes, please use
    "apptainer exec <this-image> mpirun -np <N> <executable-name> ...".

    You can also enter an interactive shell within the container with "apptainer shell <this-image>".
    However, please note almost no basic Linux command are available within the container 
    (both for portability and security reasons).
