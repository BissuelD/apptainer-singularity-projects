    This container embedds VESTA (version 3.5.8).
    For more information about this image, please run "apptainer inspect <this-image>"

    As VESTA is a visualization tools, it requires additionnal information
    to successfully use your graphical ressources through the $DISPLAY
    environment variable. As such, you should call the present image as :
    $ apptainer run <OPTIONS>  \
        --env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
        <this-image>
    
    If you want to build a script which automatizes this graphical ressources
    management, you can use something like the following command.
    
    cat > my-vesta-script.sh << 'EOF'
        apptainer run <OPTIONS>    \
            --env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
            <path-to-this-image>/<this-image>
    EOF
    
    You can also enter an interactive shell within the container with "apptainer shell <this-image>".
    However, please note almost no basic Linux command are available within the container 
    (both for portability and security reasons).
