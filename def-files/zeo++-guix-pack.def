%help
    This container embedds Zeo++ (version 0.3).
    For more information about this image, please run "apptainer inspect <this-image>"

    If you use "apptainer run <this-image>", the main executable "network" will be called.
    Without any more arguments, the help message of the executable will show.

    All other executables are available within the container in the PATH.

    You can also enter an interactive shell within the container with "apptainer shell <this-image>".
    However, please note almost no basic Linux command are available within the container 
    (both for portability and security reasons).
