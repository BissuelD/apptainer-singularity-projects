   Welcome to Apptainer !
   This image is meant as a tutorial to help understand the basics of Apptainer containers.

   You can learn the basics such as :
   - executing a command in a container through 
         "apptainer run tutorial.sif" 
      or "apptainer exec tutorial.sif echo Hi from the container !"
   - entering an interactive shell within the container through 
         "apptainer shell tutorial.sif"
      (type "exit" or use Ctrl+D to escape the interactive shell)
   - displaying help messages for a given image through 
         "apptainer run-help tutorial.sif"
      (which is the command you used if you see this message ; congratulations !) 
   - displaying the images meta-data through
         "apptainer inspect tutorial.sif"

   You may also understand how to (re)define environment variables through the "--env" flag, for instance with.
         "apptainer run --env USER=newusername tutorial.sif"
      or "apptainer run --env GREET=Hello tutorial.sif" 
   
   You shall then understand how to isolate (partially or totally) the container from the host machine
   using "--no-mount", "--no-home" or "--containall". For instance, try :
         "apptainer exec --no-mount sys tutorial.sif ls $(pwd)"
      or "apptainer exec --no-home tutorial.sif ls $HOME"
      or "apptainer exec --containall tutorial.sif"

   Eventually, you will be able to mount directories from the host machine inside the container to provide inputs
   and gather outputs. For instance :
         "date > $PWD/test-host.txt" # On host machine
         "apptainer exec --bind $PWD:/opt tutorial.sif cp /opt/test-host.txt /opt/test-container.txt"
         "cat $PWD/test-host.txt $PWD/test-container.txt" # On host machine
