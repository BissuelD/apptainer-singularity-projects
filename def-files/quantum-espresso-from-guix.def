%help
    This container embedds Quantum Espresso (version 7.3) with OpenMPI support.
    For more information about this image, please run "apptainer inspect <this-image>"

    If you use "apptainer run <this-image>", one of QE executables, "pw.x", will be called.
    You can also use "apptainer exec <this-image> <executable-name>" to select another executable.

    If you want to specify MPI number of processes, please use
    "apptainer exec <this-image> mpirun -np <N> lmp_mpi ...".

    You can also enter an interactive shell within the container with "apptainer shell <this-image>".
    However, please note almost no basic Linux command are available within the container 
    (both for portability and security reasons).
