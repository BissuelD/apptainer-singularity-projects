%help
    This container embedds LAMMPS (2 July 2021 patch) with OpenMPI support.
    For more information about this image, please run "apptainer inspect <this-image>"
    
    If you use "apptainer run <this-image>", the main executable "lmp_mpi" will be called.
    For more information about it, please use "apptainer run <this-image> -h"
    or "apptainer exec <this-image> lmp_mpi -h".

    If you want to specify MPI number of processes, please use 
    "apptainer exec <this-image> mpirun -np <N> lmp_mpi ...".

    You can also enter an interactive shell within the container with "apptainer shell <this-image>".
    However, please note almost no basic Linux command are available within the container 
    (both for portability and security reasons).

    Finally, default interatomic potentials provided with this version of LAMMPS are available within
    the container with the correct environment variables set to allow LAMMPS to locate them at runtime 
    (only used in the case where LAMMPS cannot locate the potential file in the location you specified).
